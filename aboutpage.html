All day long, there was friendly rivalry, camaraderie, and excellent sportsmanship. A variety of sports, such as volleyball, basketball, takraw, etc. were participated in by pupils in all grade levels. Vibrant banners and flags flown throughout the stadium added to the festive atmosphere. Pupils erupted with joy as they stood by each other, chanting, applauding, and yelling encouragement. An amazing environment was created by the athletes' constant dedication and devotion. It was a real example of skill commitment. As students from different grades came together to support one another, the occasion also promoted unity. The school intramurals in 2023 were about more than just winning and losing.However, the focus was on creating a lasting sense of camaraderie, teamwork, and healthy rivalry. <br><br>
